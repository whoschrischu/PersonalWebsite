    <p>"Nobody too afraid to fail has ever accomplished anything." This is a motto I currently live by.
      I've heard a countless numbers of stories of people, friends even, who have encountered new experiences
      because they welcomed them with open arms. Regardless of whether they were minimal or extravagant, the idea
      of welcoming something new and mysterious was an obstinant obstacle of mine. My journey from a coward at life
      to a more developed adventurer is hardly noticeable looking forward, but in retrospect, I've covered a vast
      distance from my starting point.

      My development as a photographer and as a web designer is in beautiful strides. Traveling with friends from the
      Bay Area to capture life's fleeting yet scorchingly awesome moments is a huge blessing. Art has never been my
      fort√© in the classroom but photography allows me to develop those skills I now use to carry into the world of
      computer science and web development.

      I've been immersed in technology and gagdgets since my first Gameboy Color in 1999. Being in the heart of
      Silicon Valley as a student at San Jose State University also helps in this growing passion for creating. One
      thing unifies this Gameboy, this Facebook page, and even this text editor I'm coding on: the user-experience.
      How will the user feel when they scroll through this website? Do these new colors have a more profound effect on
      the audience? Minimalist or not? These are questions I ask myself when I create web applications and websites.
      This is how my photograpy and web development are connected. At the end of the day, how will this picture and/or
      website make you feel?

      Let's find out together and make some stories.

			And yes, all these photos on this website were taken and edited by me.
